# random-eigenvalues
A test for my Numpy skills and to verify the Tracy-Widow distribution

## What is it?
I've read recently from the book *The Prime Number Conspiracy* that when the largest eigenvalues of random matrices are plot in a distribution, they will appear as the [Tracy-Widom Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy%E2%80%93Widom_distribution).

I want to test this distribution for different types of matrices.

## Packages Required
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
